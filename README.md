### About "Library"
**Library** is a simple REST API project that exposes CRUD operations on **Author** and **Book** resources. The purpose of the project is to involve some software development concepts like:
- IoC container
- task asynchronous programming (with ```async``` and ```await```)
- unit testing
- code segregation into separate layers
- usage of proper exception messages and HTTP status codes

### Disclaimer
Some approaches in the project are adopted for the sake of simplicity. They are subject of change for production systems.
